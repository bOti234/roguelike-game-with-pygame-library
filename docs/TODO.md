# TODO list:

-Making the design of the selectors better (e.g., fixing image sizes, positions, making letters larger, creating borders for the boxes, other colours)

-Adding an option to upgrade damage / attack speed for the weaponkit when every weapon upgrade is maxed out.

-Adding an option to upgrade player speed / heal player / create a weapon kit when every other passive is maxed out.

-Fixing balance of enemies. (stats and spawn rate)

-Fixing balance of rifle and orb.

-Fixing the balance with crowd control.

-Fixing descriptions of passives and weapons.

-Implementing all passives.

-Reducing lag when a large amount of sprite is on the screen. (e.g., experience disappears after awhile / multiple ones for one big orb, reduce bullet counts (especially with culster bombs), reduce enemy count)

-Creating all talent images. Implementing all talents.

-Adding in background elements (e.g. stones, trees, a pond where the player can't go, etc.)

-Cleaning up the code by removing any unnececary lines and making it more efficient.

-Cleaning up settings.py

-Adding bosses to the game.

There are other problems that need to be fixed, but those didn't really come to my mind. There are also biger parts of the project that are not yet implemented, those come later (e.g., main menu, settings menu, map selector, starter weapon selector, log in/sign up. user profile editing, scoreboard, etc.)
